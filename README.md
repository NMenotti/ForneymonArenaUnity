# Forneymon Arena: Unity

The Forneymon arena was a twinstick shooter themed after Dr. Andrew Forney and his Forneymon examples, along with his honor code on the first exam in Data Structures.
The primary mechanic is that rather than shooting enemies like in a traditional twinstick, you have to reflect the bullets that enemies fire back at them.

Now it is being rebuilt and re-optimized in Unity, and this repo serves as its home.

You can find a download link for the original version of the game below (for Windows). In order to run it, unzip the folder, and select the folder for your operating system, win32 or win64. If you are on windows, the application is located directly within this folder, titled ForneymonArena. Note: the original version only plays on a controller/gamepad

Box link to Unity project, because it's too large for GitHub and git LFS doesn't want to deal with it
